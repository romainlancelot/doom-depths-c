# Installation

The game runs in the CLI, so you need to have a terminal to run it.
If you are on Windows and / or don't have a compiler, don't worry i got you covered ðŸ˜Ž.
Simply run the docker image with the following command:

```bash
you@your_machine:~$ docker compose up -d --build
you@your_machine:~$ docker exec -it doomdepths bash -c "make && ./prog"
```

Otherwise, if you're truly a king and have a UNIX system ðŸ¤©, you can simply run the following command:

```bash
you@your_machine:~$ make install # This will install the required dependencies
you@your_machine:~$ make && ./prog
```

# How to play

The game is pretty simple, you have to kill the enemies and survive as long as you can.

<h1>Thanks for reading and playing our game</h1>
